# Flaskr Personal Project

<p align='center'>
In this project, I built a full-stack development project using several coding languages to create a blog called Flaskr. The blog application will allow users to register, log in, create new posts, and edit/delete their posts on this locally-run app. Furthermore, the app can be packaged and sent to other local computers.
